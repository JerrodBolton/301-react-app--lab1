# Lab: Class 01

- By the end of this week, you will create an application that displays images and information of horned animals. This application will allow you to filter the images by number of horns and I can chose my favorite image.

Things that I need to do is...

1. create a new repo on GitHub
   component needs to contain your name as the author.
2. in the root of your React application, run the following command: git remote add origin <url-to-your-gitHub-repo>

3. I need to make some component for my app

   1. Header <!-- component needs to have an <h1> with a title. -->

   - Footer <!-- component needs to contain your name as the author. -->

   - Main <!-- this need to have at least two copies of a component called HornedBeasts.-->
